function [m, v] = scinrrd_vertical_rot3( nrrd, type )
% SCINRRD_VERTICAL_ROTMAT  Compute the 3D rotation matrix to make a 3D
% segmented object vertical
%
% [M, A] = SCINRRD_VERTICAL_ROTMAT3(NRRD, TYPE)
%
%   This function computes a rotation matrix and centroid so that the input
%   SCI NRRD segmentation mask can be rotated to make the object vertical.
%
%   NRRD is the SCI NRRD struct.
%
%   M is a 2-vector with the coordinates of the segmentation mask centroid.
%   M is also the centre of rotation.
%
%   A is a (3,3)-rotation matrix defined around M.
%
%   TYPE is a string with the transformation direction:
%
%     * 'pts': (default) Forward transformation. That is, the rotation is
%              applied to the input points.
%
%     * 'img': Backward transformation. To follow the ITK (Insight Toolkit)
%              convention, A is the rotation from output to input voxel
%              coordinates.
%
%     The inverse of a rotation matrix is the transpose, so converting from
%     one type to the other just requires computing the transpose.
%
%
%   Note on SCI NRRD: Software applications developed at the University of
%   Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, e.g. Seg3D,
%   internally use NRRD volumes to store medical data.
%
%   When label volumes (segmentation masks) are saved to a Matlab file
%   (.mat), they use a struct called "scirunnrrd" to store all the NRRD
%   information:
%
%   >>  scirunnrrd
%
%   scirunnrrd = 
%
%          data: [4-D uint8]
%          axis: [4x1 struct]
%      property: []
