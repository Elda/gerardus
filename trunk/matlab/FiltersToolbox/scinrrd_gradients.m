function [dx, dy, dxx, dyy, dxy] = scinrrd_gradients(nrrd)
% SCINRRD_GRADIENTS  Compute 1st and 2nd order image gradients
%
% [DX, DY, DXX, DYY, DXY] = SCINRRD_GRADIENTS(NRRD)
%
%   This function computes the first and second order gradients of an image
%   provided in SCI NRRD format. The voxel size in each dimension is taken
%   into account when computing the gradients.
%
%   NRRD is the struct with the data.
%
%   DX, DY are the first order gradients of the image I in the X and Y
%   directions, respectively, dI/dx, dI/dy (Note: the X direction
%   corresponds to *columns*, and the Y direction corresponds to *rows*).
%
%   DXX, DYY, DXY are the second order gradients, d^2(I)/dx^2, d^2(I)/dy^2,
%   d^2(I)/dxdy.
%
%
%   Note on SCI NRRD: Software applications developed at the University of
%   Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, e.g. Seg3D,
%   internally use NRRD volumes to store medical data.
%
%   When label volumes (segmentation masks) are saved to a Matlab file
%   (.mat), they use a struct called "scirunnrrd" to store all the NRRD
%   information:
%
%   >>  scirunnrrd
%
%   scirunnrrd = 
%
%          data: [4-D uint8]
%          axis: [4x1 struct]
%      property: []
