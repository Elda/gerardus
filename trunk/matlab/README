This file is part of the Matlab Toolboxes of project Gerardus.

Toolboxes in Gerardus:
======================

* FileFormatToolbox

	Functions to create image files or convert image files from
	one format to another.

* FiltersToolbox

	Filters to enhance or transform images in general.

* PointsToolbox

	Functions to operate with sets of points.


FileFormatToolbox:
==================

dcm2mat.m:

	If you have a bunch of DICOM (.dcm) files, one per slice, and
	you want to create a single Matlab (.mat) file with all the
	slices collated together. It attempts to detect time series
	too, and in that case, it creates a 4D matrix.

dcm2metaimage.m:

	If you have a bunch of DICOM (.dcm) files, one per slice, and
	you want to create a single MetaImage file with all the slices
	collated together. Note that a MetaImage file in fact is split
	into a header file (.mha) and a data file (.raw).

im2metaimage.m:

	If you have a bunch of image files (e.g. TIFF, PNG, JPG,
	etc.), one per slice, and you want to create a single
	MetaImage file with all the slices collated together. Note
	that a MetaImage file in fact is split into a header file
	(.mha) and a data file (.raw).

matlab2vox_seg3d.m:

	Convert Matlab file with Seg3D segmentation to .vox format (for
	the Tarantula meshing application).

scirunnrrd_index2world.m:

	Convert data volume indices to real world coordinates for NRRD
	volumes created by SCI applications (e.g. Seg3D).

scirunnrrd_world2index.m:

	Convert real world coordinates to data volume indices for NRRD
	volumes created by SCI applications (e.g. Seg3D).

sortdirbynum.m:

	List the files in a directory ordering them by a numerical
	substring field in the file name. This function is useful  to
	determine the order in which slices will be collated when you
	have filenames like
	MISAS_DT_22_10_2009.MR.HEAD_GENERAL.6.10.2009.10.23.16.02.38.562500.9699412.BMP.


WriteMhaFile.m:

	Write the header part of a MetaImage file (.mha).

WriteRawFile.m:

	Write the binary part of a MetaImage file (.raw).


FiltersToolbox:
===============

correct_light_blobs_in_microscope_mosaic.m:

	Correct the colour blob created by the microscope's light in
	each tile of a mosaic, e.g. for histology.

scirunnrrd_vertical_rot3.m:

	Compute the 3D rotation matrix to make a point cloud vertical.

PointsToolbox:
==============

cube_stackable_tessellation.m:

	Tessellation in tetrahedra of a cube that can be stacked in a
	regular mesh.

cube_five_tessellation.m:

	Tessellation in 5 tetrahedra of a cube with perpendicular
	diagonals on opposite sides of the cube (non-stackable)

polycenter.m:

	Compute center of mass and area of polygon.

pts_kmat.m:

	Compute kernel matrix for Linear and Kernel Principal
	Component Analysis (PCA and KPCA).

pts_pca.m:

	Linear and Kernel Principal Component Analysis (PCA and
	KPCA).

quaternion2matrix.m:

	Convert quaternion to rotation matrix.

scirunnrrd_pca.m:

	Principal Principal Component Analysis of the selected points
	in a SCI NRRD segmentation mask.
