	* First public release to project Gerardus in Google Code of this
	Matlab Toolbox.

	- http://code.google.com/p/gerardus

	* Add README with help for functions in the Toolbox.

	* WriteMetaFile.h -> WriteRawFile.h:

	- Correct name, as "Meta" could refer to MetaImage, the format
	that includes both the mha header and the raw file.

	* dcm2metadata.m -> dcm2metaimage.m, im2metadata.m ->
	im2metaimage.m:
	
	Correct filenames and function names, because we are create
	MetaImage files, not "metadata".

	* Add LICENCE with text of the GPL v3, and corresponding copyright
	notices to all files.

	* Add correct_light_blobs_in_microscope_mosaic.m:

	- CORRECT_LIGHT_BLOBS_IN_MICROSCOPE_MOSAIC Correct the colour blob
	created by the microscope's light in each tile of a mosaic,
	e.g. for histology.

2009-04-02  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add dcm2metadata.m:

	- DCM2METADATA  Read a batch of DICOM files, collate them and save
	as a single metadata volume (one .mha and one .raw file).

	* Add matlab2vox_seg3d.m:

	- MATLAB2VOX_SEG3D Convert Matlab file with Seg3D segmentation to
	vox format (for the Tarantula meshing application).

	* im2metadata.m:

	- Add input argument "crop", so that the volume can be cropped
	before saving.

	* WriteMhaFile.m:

	- Add help comments.

	- Write 'Offset' line to file, so that cropped data is correctly
	placed.

2009-01-19  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* WriteMhaFile.m, WriteMetaFile.m:
	
	- Increase precission for values of ElementSpacing, from 4 digits
	to 12 digits, to make sure that we can save spacings in microns.

	* Add im2metadata.m.

	- IM2METADATA Read a batch of image files, collate them and save
	as a single metadata volume (one .mha and one .raw file).

2009-01-15  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* WriteMhaFile.m, WriteMetaFile.m: v0.2.

	- Add MET_USHORT as output type for uint16 input data.

	- Add error message if the data type is not one of the expected
	types. Otherwise, no ElementType header is added to the file, this
	is not reported, and then Seg3D (and possibly other image
	visualisation applications) will fail to open the file.

	* Add files provided by Martin Bishop to write metadata
	files. These files were actually created originally by Vicente
	Grau.
