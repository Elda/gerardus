% SCIRUNNRRD_INTERSECT_PLANE  Optimise intersection plane for SCI NRRD

%
% [QOPT, MOPT] = SCIRUNNRRD_INTERSECT_PLANE(IM, Z0)
%
%   This function computes the plane that intersects a SCI NRRD
%   segmentation mask in a way that minimizers the segmentation area
%   intersected by the plane. That is, in some sense in finds the plane
%   more orthogonal to the segmented volume.
%
%   (Note that the area is computed on the convex hull of the plane
%   intersection with the volume.)
%
%   IM is the SCI NRRD struct.
%
%   Z0 is a z-coordinate value. The rotation centroid for the plane will be
%   at Z0 height.
%
%   QOPT is the quaternion that describes the optimal rotation of the plane
%   around centroid MOPT so that the intersection area is minimised.
%
%
%   Note on SCI NRRD: Software applications developed at the University of
%   Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, e.g. Seg3D,
%   internally use NRRD volumes to store medical data.
%
%   When label volumes (segmentation masks) are saved to a Matlab file
%   (.mat), they use a struct called "scirunnrrd" to store all the NRRD
%   information:
%
%   >>  scirunnrrd
%
%   scirunnrrd = 
%
%          data: [4-D uint8]
%          axis: [4x1 struct]
%      property: []
