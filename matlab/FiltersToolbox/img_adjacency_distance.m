function a = img_adjacency_distance(im)
% ADJACENCY_DISTANCE  Convert image to adjacency-distance list in sparse matrix form
%
% A = IMG_ADJACENCY_DISTANCE(IM)
%
%   IM is an image volume with dimensions (R, C, S).
%
%   A is a sparse matrix with dimensions (R*C*S, R*C*S), where element
%   (i,j) is the mean intensity between voxels with linear indices i and j.
%
%   Voxels with an Inf intensity are skipped.
