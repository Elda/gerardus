% SCINRRD_VALVE_SURFACE  Inter atrio-ventricular surface
%
% NRRD = SCINRRD_VALVE_SURFACE(NRRD0, X)
%
%   NRRD0 is the SCI NRRD struct that contains the cardiac Magnetic
%   Resonance Image (MRI).
%
%   X is a 3-row matrix. Each column has the coordinates of a point from
%   one of the valve annula.
%
%   NRRD is a SCI NRRD struct with a segmentation of the surface that
%   interpolates the valve annula points.
%
% NRRD = SCINRRD_VALVE_SURFACE(NRRD0, X, HOR)
%
%   HOR is a flag. If HOR=true, the valve points are rotated to make the
%   first 2 eigenvectors of their principal components horizontal. By
%   default, HOR=false.
%
%   Note on SCI NRRD: Software applications developed at the University of
%   Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, e.g. Seg3D,
%   internally use NRRD volumes to store medical data.
%
%   When label volumes (segmentation masks) are saved to a Matlab file
%   (.mat), they use a struct called "scirunnrrd" to store all the NRRD
%   information:
%
%   >>  scirunnrrd
%
%   scirunnrrd = 
%
%          data: [4-D uint8]
%          axis: [4x1 struct]
%      property: []
