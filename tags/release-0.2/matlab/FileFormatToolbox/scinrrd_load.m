function nrrd = scinrrd_load(file)
% SCINRRD_LOAD  Load a NRRD struct saved to Matlab format
%
% NRRD = SCINRRD_LOAD(FILE)
%
%   This function loads the NRRD volume, removes the dummy dimension and
%   corrects the row/column order so that the Seg3D image matches Matlab's.
%
%   FILE is a string with the path and name of the .mat file that contains
%   the NRRD volume.
%
%    NRRD is the SCI NRRD struct.
%
%   Note on SCI NRRD: Software applications developed at the University of
%   Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, e.g. Seg3D,
%   internally use NRRD volumes to store medical data.
%
%   When label volumes (segmentation masks) are saved to a Matlab file
%   (.mat), they use a struct called "scirunnrrd" to store all the NRRD
%   information:
%
%   >>  scirunnrrd
%
%   scirunnrrd = 
%
%          data: [4-D uint8]
%          axis: [4x1 struct]
%      property: []
