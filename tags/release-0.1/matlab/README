This file is part of the Matlab Toolbox of project Gerardus.


This Matlab Toolbox provides the following main functions:
==========================================================

dcm2metaimage.m:

	If you have a bunch of DICOM (.dcm) files, one per slice, and
	you want to create a single MetaImage file with all the slices
	collated together. Note that a MetaImage file in fact is split
	into a header file (.mha) and a data file (.raw).

im2metaimage.m:

	If you have a bunch of image files (e.g. TIFF, PNG, JPG,
	etc.), one per slice, and you want to create a single
	MetaImage file with all the slices collated together. Note
	that a MetaImage file in fact is split into a header file
	(.mha) and a data file (.raw).

matlab2vox_seg3d.m:

	Convert Matlab file with Seg3D segmentation to .vox format (for
	the Tarantula meshing application).

correct_light_blobs_in_microscope_mosaic.m:

	Correct the colour blob created by the microscope's light in
	each tile of a mosaic, e.g. for histology.


It also provides the following auxiliary functions:
===================================================

WriteMhaFile.m:

	Write the header part of a MetaImage file (.mha).

WriteRawFile.m:

	Write the binary part of a MetaImage file (.raw).
