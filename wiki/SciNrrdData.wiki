#summary Notes about SCI NRRD data volumes

= Introduction =

Gerardus provides some Matlab functions to load, process and save images in [http://teem.sourceforge.net/nrrd/format.html SCI NRRD] format. This is the native format used by the platform [http://www.sci.utah.edu/cibc/software/42-seg3d.html Seg3D].

This page contains some notes on the SCI NRRD format.

== Rows and columns correspondence to x, y-coordinates ==

The way Seg3D stores images in .mat files establishes the following correspondence:

 x <=> rows

 y <=> columns

 z <=> slice

Note that this is different from the Matlab convention of using columns for the x-coordinate and rows for the y-coordinate.

Because Matlab is so widely used, in order to make this discrepancy invisible to the user, functions `scinrrd_load()` and `scinrrd_save()` swap the rows and columns accordingly.

That is, data loaded using `scinrrd_load()` follows the convention

 y <=> rows

 x <=> columns

 z <=> slice

This convention is assumed by all the other [http://code.google.com/p/gerardus/source/browse/#svn/trunk/matlab Gerardus Matlab] functions.
