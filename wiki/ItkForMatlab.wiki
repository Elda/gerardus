#summary Documentation to build and run ITK code from Matlab using Gerardus
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

This page documents `itk_imfilter()` and `itk_kernel_transform()`, MEX functions provided by Gerardus that allow to run ITK code from Matlab.

 * *`itk_imfilter()`:* Run ITK filters on a 2D or 3D image
 * *`itk_kernel_transform()`:* ITK warps between 3D point sets with a known correspondence

This project is similar to [http://matitk.cs.sfu.ca/ MATITK], although it has been developed from scratch.


= Requirements =

 * [http://www.cmake.org/ CMake]
  # [http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html Download] and install CMake for your system (Linux, Windows, MacOS X, etc). 
  * Note for Linux users: CMake is probably packaged for your distribution. For example, Ubuntu users can install it doing
{{{
$ sudo apt-get install cmake
}}}
  * Note for Windows users: Download and run the Win32 Installer from the [http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html CMake downloads page]
 * [http://www.itk.org/itkindex.html Insight Toolkit]
  # [http://www.itk.org/ITK/resources/software.html Download the Insight Toolkit (ITK)]
  # Install ITK using CMake (see the [http://www.itk.org/ItkSoftwareGuide.pdf ITK Software Guide] for details)
