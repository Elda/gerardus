#summary Instructions on how to add a new ITK filter to itk_imfilter().

= Introduction =

This page provides step-by-step instructions on how to add a new ITK filter to the Gerardus Matlab MEX function itk_imfilter().

All filters must either of type [http://www.itk.org/Doxygen320/html/classitk_1_1ImageToImageFilter.html itk::ImageToImageFilter] or inherit from it.

= Changes needed on the C++ side of Gerardus (`gerardus/cpp/src/third-party`) =

 * If the filter is already part of ITK (whether the standard or Review packages), then nothing needs to be done in this section
 * If the filter comes from an external source, e.g. the [http://hdl.handle.net/1926/558 itk::AnisotropicDiffusionVesselEnhancementImageFilter] from the Insight Journal, then
  # Put the filter's C++ files in a new subdirectory within `gerardus/cpp/src/third-party`, e.g. 
{{{
gerardus/cpp/src/third-party/IJ-Vessel_Enhancement_Diffusion.1
}}}
  # Add the new subdirectory to the repository, add a reference in the `ChangeLog` file to where the code was downloaded from, and commit it, e.g.
{{{
$ cd gerardus
$ svn add cpp/src/third-party/IJ-Vessel_Enhancement_Diffusion.1
$ emacs ChangeLog
$ svn ci
}}}

= Changes needed on the Matlab side of Gerardus (`gerardus/matlab/ItkToolbox`) =

  # edit `gerardus/matlab/ItkToolbox/CMakeLists.txt` to include the new subdirectory in the build
{{{
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(
  ${GERARDUS_SOURCE_DIR}/cpp/src/third-party/itkBinaryThinningImageFilter3D/Source
  ${GERARDUS_SOURCE_DIR}/cpp/src/third-party/IJ-Vessel_Enhancement_Diffusion.1
  )
